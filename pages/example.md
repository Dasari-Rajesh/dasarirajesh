## Key Projects
<strong>Notify Me</strong> <br>
Instructor : Prof. Amitabha Sanyal |Course Project         {Autumn 2020|IIT Bombay}

• Worked on an application to create a Centralized Notification System whereby a professor can send
real-time notifications to the students enrolled utilsing the application<br>
• Built a Dashboard, similar to moodle/Teams, using Django where a Professor can view the list of recipients
who acknowledged a notification and can set deadlines for an event<br>
• Designed a corresponding Android Application using Android Studio to resemble a virtual classroom
environment(Google Classroom) which is much needed in this coronavirus crisis<br>

<strong>GIF(Graphics Interchange Format)</strong><br>
Instructor : Prof. Rushikesh K.Joshi | Course Project      {Spring 2020|IIT Bombay}

• Implemented a C++ class for creation and efficient way of portraying animations using Fltk (Fast Light
ToolKit), a cross-platform widget library for Graphical User Interfaces <br>
• Used simple Widgets provided by Fltk for implementation of a class named gif to represent Simple Harmonic
Motion of a ball constrained to move in a straight line<br>
• Extended this idea to create a gif with 8 balls arranged in a beautiful manner, so that they apparently move
in a circle with proper contrast between the surroundings and the components.<br>
• Implemented various beautiful designs using the tools provided by Fltk as a part of this project<br>

<strong>Image Segmentation</strong> <br>
Instructor : Prof. Amitabha Sanyal | Course Project        {Autumn 2020|IIT Bombay}

• Used Kmeans++ algorithm and python Scipy Library to smoothen high contrast images.<br>
• Utilized NumPy, Pandas, SciPy libraries of Python to store pixels of images in matrix form.<br>
• Using K-means algorithm to find centroid and replaced all pixels by it’s centroid for image segmentation.<br>
